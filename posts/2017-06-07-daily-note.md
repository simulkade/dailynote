Writing here is like spitting out all the useless and very occasionally useful thoughts that comes to my mind. These days, I'm also writing other stuff that I find extremely boring and only useful if it gives the result I want, otherwise a wasted effort (I don't want to say what I really write). Doing nothing is better than what I'm doing now. The thing is it must be done and only I have to do it. Still, complaining about it feels good!  

I do not understand the possibility of having a negatively charged carbonate surface without any sulfate or carbonate ions in the system.
