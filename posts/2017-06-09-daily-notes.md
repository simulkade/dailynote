Today, I wasted some time finding a time management app for my Linux Mint installation. There is an applet for it, called Pomodoro with a nice red ripe tomato icon. I managed to waste a few minutes getting it to work, and it is running on my computer toolbar now.  

One of the most idiotic things in this Dell laptop's keyboard is that the page up/down keys are located right next to the arrow keys. I have pressed them more that a thousand times by mistake. Are these keys even necessary for a keyboard?
