Another Monday at the library, spending my paternity leave on the topic I like and enjoy. I spent most of my time drawing figures and process flow diagrams. I could not find a good tool for drawing Sankey diagrams. So I do it in matplotlib, which is rather limited, save the results in `svg` format, and edit the file in Inkscape.
