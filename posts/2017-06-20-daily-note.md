1- Just finished the figures. I feel this mental bareer that stops me from finishing the geothermal energy paper. I have to focus and finish it.

2- The pressure in a cell with constant source/sink terms is extremely mesh dependent. By refining the mesh, I constantly get a higher pressure for a cell with a source term, and a lower pressure for a cell with a sink term.
