Working on the replies to the reviewers of our DME injection paper. I have updated most of the simulation files for a new paper, which makes it difficult to find the relevant older results; that part is done now. There are also lots of assumptions in the paper, which are mostly based on the very limited (and, I datre to say, low quality) experimental data set. That's probably my main answer to most of the questions. That, and some remarks based on our inhouse experimental data that we cannot publish yet, because it's somebody else's work.
